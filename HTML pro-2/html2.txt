	<h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
	<p>
		 Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.
		It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.
	</p>
	<h3>Why is cyber security important?</h3>
	<p>
		The costs of cyber security breaches are rising.
		Organisations that suffer cyber security breaches may face significant fines. There are also non-financial costs to be considered, like reputational damage.
	</p>
	<h3>Who needs cyber security?</h3>
	<p>
		It is a mistake to believe that you are of no interest to cyber attackers. Everyone who is connected to the Internet needs cyber security. This is because most cyber attacks are automated and aim to exploit common vulnerabilities rather than specific websites or organisations.
